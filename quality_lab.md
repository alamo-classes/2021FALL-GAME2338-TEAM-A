## Favorite Games among group and why

## Game 1: Destiny 2 (William)
Besides personally enjoying the games story and how it plays (sort of lol). 
Destiny 2 has a lot going on inside it, and I'm surprised of how much better its doing now with all the time sets they have given themselves.
I believe its a good quality game because of the replayability and constant little updates every week.
As it does the community and developers seem to be getting in a better relationship, as bug reports and issues are very quickly noted. Heck, even the developers will lay out bugs found before a new update. Don't get why people are so upset about it.


## Game 2: Apex Legends


## Game 3: Dying Light
