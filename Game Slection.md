### Reason for choosing Destiny 2

* We chose Destiny 2 because all of us have been playing this game for years and have come to love this game. 

* Its a common game we play and it wouldn't be too difficult to review for a first time (in the project sense).

### Description of Destiny 2

Destiny 2 is a First Person Shooter that puts the player into a galactic battle between light and dark.

Destiny 2 is a first person shooter MMO. It follows the RPG gun game style taking place across the solar system.
It mainly strives on that grindy gun play to hook the players, as well with having different sub classes of abilities.
The guns/armors are where the primary focus is. Players find their preferred builds for different situations. Work together with them and all that.
As the game goes on (say from a new players perspective), they're expected to have these different aspects down for the end game activities.

## Final Thoughts

Overall Destiny 2 is a very good game that can crash, or freeze while playing as of the latest updates, or if there are to many supers cast at the same time. 

Destiny 2 is a mess sometimes, but it can be a wonderful game to play with friends. There's so much going on but at the same time so much lacking.
Its understandable that its set up to be where the player has to take care of themselves with their builds and weapons and mods. Theres a lot to unlock that it keeps you interested.
The problems come in when you look at some quality of life and balancing. It lacks where you can help other plays (with giving items/materials), or having such a difficult
level cap to where it seems almost impossible and no reason to continue. The insane PVP mess that a lot of the community actively avoids.
But the content to keep players engaged and working together is amazing. It has some of the most unique cooperative gameplay to the point that I miss it when my friends
played it a lot. I do hope they fix the issues at some point, or just my friends playing it again.
If you have a good group to play with, and a lot of time. Definitely play Destiny to its current full.
