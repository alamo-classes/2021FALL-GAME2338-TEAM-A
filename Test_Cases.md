## Overall Test Status:

This was a sort of constant cycle of doing the same thing over and over. Interestingly by the thrid run there was new small, but notable bugs.
1st run played through without any issue, nothing I personally noticed as I was warming up for a couple of rounds for this

During the second run, keeping an eye out more I noticed some of the map wasn't entirely connected. I could see through a crack in the floor. Also more funny but a hunters cloak was being glitchy. This always happens since the game released but I'll put it here anyways.

Third was was more concerning, as midway through the dialouge with the Ghost cut off. Music played as normal but no more dialouge was said from anyone. Even when the visual cue
for it was shown. Strike played out as normal.

Fourth and final was overall normal. A small visual bug of the players (mine) gun cutting invisible and visible upon switching real quick.
