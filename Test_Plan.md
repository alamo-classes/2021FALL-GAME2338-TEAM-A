# Section 1: General Information

## Summary

An Online MMO PvE experience that lets players in up to 6 in a group work together and complete missions and task. The engine is a mix of unreal and Saber3D (Can't really
figure this out as they call it "the one we used for halo" so I can refer it to the "Halo Engine" I guess). 

Destiny 2 can be played on PC, Xbox and Playstation.

This whole test will be checking for balance, "fun", and any (visual or gameplay) bug along the way. As well as game inputs are fully functional.

## Environment/User Community

A closed out environment remotely.

## Test Objectives

To make sure the game is balanced via weapons and difficulty.
Make suire the games inputs work properly.

## Acceptance Criteria

Errors (Visual and Gameplay) are expected to happen. They are allowed to be noted and correctly fixed as time goes on.
Input errors are required to be reported, as its something that shouldn't be broken at the time.

Overall Destiny 2 is mid way on its last season till Witch Queen is released. Currently they released "TWAB" that talks about a lot of nerfs to abilities in the game.
But this test will focus on the balancing in this season, before all the changes occur in the new season.

# Section 2: Plan
## Test Description

Balancing will be the main focus throughout this test. This will be tested through experimentation with gunplay, and how mods and abilities affect the overall gameplay
in the PvE areas to it. (PvP would be pages and pages worth of why its unbalanced.) Testers will need a fully functioning keyboard and mouse, or controller depending
on whatever console they wish to test on.

## Methods and Constraints

### Test Methodology

Compatibility/Functional/Usability Testing

### Extent of Testing

Working with controls to see if they're easy enough to control and use.
If theres time, we'll go over the balancing.

### Constraints

We have many places to test movement, and the functionality won't take long. However understanding the balance in this game is difficult. There might not be time to fully understand it all before it changes again.
